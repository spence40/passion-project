<h3 class="h3"> About Spotlight Dance</h3>

  <div class="sections"> 
    Our mission is to instill a great love of dance, while inspiring self-confidence, discipline and respect of the performing arts. We provide a solid technical foundation for the developing dancer. We advocate the study of Classical Ballet as a foundation to instill an awareness of poise, alignment and technique. Our goal is to give each individual dancer the tools they need to take dance as far as they dream to take it. We believe if you can dream it you can achieve it! Our instructors are skilled at identifying the specific needs of each student. We believe in an enriching education and we recognize that every student has something to offer the arts and the arts has something to every student.

We appreciate that the heart of a dancer is born into many different bodies and the love of dance can take on many different styles. We will develop well-prepared dancers, should they so choose to pursue the arts professionally or are college bound. Once a dancer always a dancer, dance is something students can come back to during all stages of their life.

We will urge each student to strive daily for their personal best, as well as to support one another in fostering a sense of teamwork in the classroom.

It is clear that the discipline, focus and artistic enlightenment of dance creates success in all aspects of life. Dance education contributes to the development of responsible, dedicated, determined, and creative adults in society. </div>

<p> The studio is spacious and in a great location. It also has a big waiting room for the parents and so nice to be able to watch the dance classes on a t.v in the waiting room. The teachers are exceptional and really care about the kids. We have had a great experience with Spotlight Dance Company. </p>
